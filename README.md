# Address Locator, Network Dataset, and Basic Network Analysis for Krakow Municipality

## Overview
This project focuses on building an address locator, a network dataset, and performing basic network analyses for the municipality of Krakow. The analysis includes various routes and areas of interest, such as the shortest path between locations, the influence of barriers, and optimized routes to popular destinations like ice cream shops and university campuses.

## Key Features of the Analysis
- **Shortest Path (Reymonta 7 -> Central Square) by Distance**:  
  Displays the shortest path between Reymonta 7 and Plac Centralny (Central Square) based on distance, considering nearby fuel stations along the route.

- **Fastest Route (Reymonta 7 -> Central Square) by Time**:  
  Identifies the quickest route between Reymonta 7 and Plac Centralny, with a focus on time efficiency, also accounting for nearby fuel stations.

- **Optimal Route Considering Barriers (Reymonta 7 -> Central Square)**:  
  Highlights the best route between Reymonta 7 and Plac Centralny while factoring in barriers, such as the Aleje Trzech Wieszczów road.

- **Ice Cream Shop Route (Good Lood)**:  
  Provides an optimal route across multiple Good Lood ice cream shop locations throughout Krakow, showcasing time and distance for an efficient ice cream tour.

- **Proximity of AGH and PK Universities (Up to 30 min)**:  
  Analyzes the areas around AGH and Politechnika Krakowska universities that are reachable within a 30-minute commute, showing the concentration of ice cream shops near student areas.

- **Nearest Object from EXPO Krakow**:  
  Displays the closest object (Good Lood Nowa Huta) from the Krakow EXPO center, highlighting the accessibility of popular destinations from major landmarks.

## Methodology
- **Data Used**: The dataset incorporates road networks, barriers, fuel stations, and Good Lood ice cream shops.
- **Tools**: The analysis was conducted using Geographic Information Systems (GIS) for spatial analysis and network modeling.
- **Visualization**: Multiple maps provide visual representations of routes and areas of serviceability, enhancing the understanding of Krakow’s transport and accessibility landscape.
